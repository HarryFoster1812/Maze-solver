# Maze-solver

A simple maze solving algorithm that uses a* to solve different mazes, writen in c# using the .net framework and visual studio, made for a school practice project.

The mazes are inputed from the folder labeled "Mazes" and are in a text based format with # being used for the walls and " " used for availiable squares "S" used to indicate the start and "E" to indicate the end. If you are going to create your own maze please make sure that each row has the same amount of characters on each line as if not then the file reading will fail and cause an error. 

You need to replace the location in the source code and recompile in order to run
